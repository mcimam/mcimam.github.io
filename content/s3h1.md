## Dear My Love


Solve this problem, and glory and **rewards** will be yours.  
But dare to fail, you must send **it** to me.  

The challenge is simple.  
Solve for the variables **a** and **b** in the given equation.  
Once you've found the solution, send me a picture of the graph.  

Are you brave enough to accept the challenge?

\[ a = |15 - 8| \]
\[ b = (\int_{1}^{2} (2x + 1) \, dx) / 2 \]
\[a\left(x^{b} + \left(y - x^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^{b}\right) = 2001\]
